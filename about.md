# About me
My name is Caden Knox and I am 20 years old. I am a computer science student studying at Boise State University. I recieved my associate degree in computer science from Orange Coast College in California, and transferred to Bosie State in Fall 2025.\
While I enjoy software and web developemnt, my biggest passion is game development. I've been making games for over five years and it is essentially my dream career. Making games solo requires a lot of knowledge in different creative areas, such as programming, 3D modeling, music production, game design, 2D art, and sound design. There is no real end to the learning experience and that's one of my favorite things about game development.\
